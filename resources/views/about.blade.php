                    <p>Hi! I'm Hermes James Berry Riconalla. I am 20 years old. I am the second among our siblings. I live in Escario St. Purok 4 Upper Camputhaw Cebu City. I am a 4th year student at University of Cebu taking up the course Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am a curious, adventurous, calm, easygoing, open-minded type of person. But, I'm one of the most sarcastic person you will ever meet.</p>
                    <p>Being a college student has allowed me to have new hobbies and interests I never knew I had. At college, I gained some knowledge on coding computers, designing and developing our own websites. In my spare time, I playing video games and basketball with my friends especially during weekends. I also love reading novels. Percy Jackson and the Olympians series by Rick Riordan is one of my favorite series. Followed by the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. I also love dogs. I'm a also a fan of Marvel Comics. Doing good deeds to other people always puts me in a good mood.</p>
                    <p>As of now, my goal is to graduate from college so that I can help my family. Someday, I want to be a promising web designer and developer and hopefully get a stable job in the near future. I want to travel around the world.</p>
